# Projects for the NeuroGlancer computing project
## Milestone 1 - Correction of alignment of reference atlas to new brain
## Milestone 2 - Addition of new annotation by an expert anatomist
Add a new structure, which is labeled as a landmark.  
This is performed by drawing a contour to every relevant section in the stack of brain slices.  
Each successive section shows a shadow version of the previous contour for purposes of aiding the anatomist.  
As the contour is drawn in the projections that corresponds to the orientation of the slice, NeuroGlance will calculate the surface and render it in 3-D. This must be accomplished, at least in an approximate way, instantaneously (i.e., < 20 ms).  
Upon completion of labeling, generate full 3-D (possibly with a delay to reflect communication and computational times) and display.  
Permit correction of contours or contour segments for individual slices. 
Permit notes per new structure.
## Milestone 3 - Labeling of markers
